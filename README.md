A Teltron Beam Deflection Tube Simulator


The Teltron apparatus includes a set of electron beam tubes that are used to demonstrate, amongst other things,
*the interaction of charged particles with electric and magnetic fields
*a procedure for determining the charge:mass ratio of the electron
*diffraction of electrons

This is a simulation of the electron beam deflection tube, where the beam passes into a region containing an approximately uniform magnetic field and and a approximately uniform electric field that are mutually perpendicular with the beam axis. The intensity of each field and the speed of the electrons can be modified. Usually this is done in such a way that the beam deflection is eliminated - the equilibrium of forces is used to derive the charge to mass ratio of the electron.
